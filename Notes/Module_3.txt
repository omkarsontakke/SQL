Module 3: Constraints & Keys (Data Integrity + Relationships)

What are Constraints?
Ans:- Constrain are ruled enforce by the database to protect data integrity.
    They Insure that
        1. No invalid data
        2. No Duplicate identifier
        3. Valid relationship between tables

Types of Constants in MySQL?
1. Primary Key    -> uniquely identify the row, cannot be NULL, One per table
2. FOREIGN KEY    -> Enforce RelationShip
3. UNIQUE         -> Prevent Duplicate Values, In MySQL only one NULL value allowed in column
4. NOT NULL       -> Disallows the NULL values -> It ensure mandotory data present
5. CHECK          -> Validate Condition, CHECK (balance >= 0)
6. DEFAULT        -> SET Default value


ON DELETE / ON UPDATE Rules :
    It defines what happens to rows in a child table when the referenced row from the parent table is deleted or updated.

1. ON DELETE CASCADE: When parent row deleted, child row deleted automatically.
2. ON UPDATE CASCADE: When parent row updated, Child row updated automatically.


Q1. Why is primary key important?
Ans:- It uniquely identifies rows and enforces entity integrity.

Q2. Can a table have multiple primary keys?
Ans:- No, but it can have a composite primary key.

Q3. Difference between UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY?
Ans:- PRIMARY KEY disallows NULL and is one per table; UNIQUE allows NULLs.

Q4. What happens if you delete a parent row with foreign key?
Ans:- Depends on ON DELETE rule (CASCADE, RESTRICT, etc.).

Q5. Why not rely only on Java validation instead of DB constraints?
Ans:- Because DB constraints ensure integrity across all applications and entry points.
